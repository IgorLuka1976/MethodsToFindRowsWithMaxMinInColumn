Methods To Find Rows with Max or Min data in column ,depending on performance

-----Important
USE AdventureWorks2019

Here are 3 examples, using:
  1. Subquery
  2. Inner Join
  3. Top...OrderBY

Visually clearer and easier to perceive is Top...OrderBY, but with a large number of rows , the search takes a long time.
Therefore, this method is suitable for small tables.

Methods with Subquery and Inner Join work well with large tables.
